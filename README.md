# GolFood-Restaurant-Mobile-App
This project is a food ordering application created in order to enable businesses serving in the food industry to reach users more efficiently and to enable users to shop with transactions.
FireBase is used as database.
Normally a custom middleware would be used as a remote server but due to timeout the middleware was aborted.
Revoked middleware: https://github.com/Programmer54/GolFood-Restaurant-Middleware
